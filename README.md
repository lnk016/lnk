# lnk

A minimal AUR helper written in C.

## Notes

- This tool does not review PKGBUILDs for you, you are responsible for trusting the package.
- Only installs one package at a time
- It is not a full featured AUR helper (no search, no upgrades, no dependency resolution beyond what makepkg provides).

## Dependencies

- git
- base-devel

## Usage

`./lnk <package name>`
